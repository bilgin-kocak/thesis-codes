# Thesis Codes

This repository has codes which are used in thesis which titled as [Computational Modeling of Self-assembly in Deformable Bodies](https://open.metu.edu.tr/handle/11511/92237) You directly download thesis from [here](https://open.metu.edu.tr/bitstream/handle/11511/92237/10423005.pdf)


You can use directly **ipynb** files in [**Google Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com/).

## Chapter 2

Chapter 2 codes are in chapter 2 folder.
- **Cahn_Hilliard_Solution.ipynb** file includes solution of Cahn-Hilliard Problem with convergence analysis example (Page:28), with different free energy density function (Page:34) and Cahn-Hilliard Solution obtained from C0 and C2 element examples (Page:46 and Page:48). For C2 elements [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/) is used instead of [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/)
- **Allen_Cahn_Equation.ipynb** file has solution of Allen-Cahn Problems (Page:42)
- **Cahn-Hilliard-Oono equation.ipynb** file has solution of Phase-Field Crystal Problem 1 and 2  (Page:50 and Page:51 ). This file also includes generalized Cahn-Hilliard Solutions such as Tumor Growth Problem and Cahn-Hilliard Oono Problem as non-thesis codes.


## Chapter 3

Chapter 3 codes are in chapter 3 folder.
- **three_field_problem_curvature_2D.py** file has solution of Three-Field Coupled Problem (Page:65)
- **three_field_problem_3D.py** file has solution of same Three-Field Coupled Problem in 3D Settings.
- **three_field_problem_curvature_dyadic_2D.py** file has solution of Three-Field Coupled Problem including extra coupled term (Page:72)

## Chapter 4

Chapter 4 codes are in chapter 4 folder.
- **diblockcopolymer_3D.py** file has solution of Onion Shape Problem in 3D Settings (Page:90)
- **coupled_cahn_hilliard.ipynb** file includes both first coupled Cahn-Hilliard Problem and Oinion Shape Problem in 2D settings (Page:85 and 87) This file also includes different shapes from solution coupled Cahn-Hilliard Equations.


## Chapter 5

Chapter 5 codes are in chapter 5 folder.
- **FLVE_cahn_hilliards.ipynb** file has solution of Coupling of Self Assembly and Finite Viscoelasticity Problem (Page:100)
